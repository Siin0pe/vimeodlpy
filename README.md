## Overview

`vimeodlpy` is a minimal yet powerful tool for downloading Vimeo videos through their HLS streams, using `ffmpeg` under the hood. It supports direct and embedded Vimeo player URLs, with optional proxy and referer headers for restricted content.

You can use it as a **Python library** or via a simple **command-line interface**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Extracts HLS stream URLs automatically from Vimeo pages
- 🎞️ Downloads video using `ffmpeg` with a live progress bar
- 🌍 Supports custom proxy and referer headers
- 🐍 Usable as both CLI and Python module
- 💡 Simple and lightweight, no browser automation or login required

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python **3.11 or newer**
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and available in your system `PATH`

To verify if FFmpeg is accessible:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
````

---
